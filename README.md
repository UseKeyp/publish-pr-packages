# Prerequisites

1. This tool requires lerna for versioning and publishing. You must install it in the root of your repo with the following command:

```bash
yarn add --dev lerna
lerna init
```

2. Next ensure your `package.json` includes the packages you want to publish in the workspaces: 

```json
{
  "workspaces": [
    "packages/*"
  ]
}
```

3. You must also copy the `/tasks` directory to the root of your repo. I'm open to suggestions/contributions to help eliminate this step!
